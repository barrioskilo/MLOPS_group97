### Project structure

## Project Description

### Goal
The overall goal of the project consists of applying all the different material that has been taught in the "02476 Machine Learning Operations Jan 24" course of the DTU. These will be applied to an image classication problem related to pistachios by focusing on data augmentation tasks while using one of the given frameworks to do so. Finally, a presentation about our findings and the submission of the final report will be made.

### Framework
For the framework part, Kornia framework for Computer Vision has been chosen. The main purpose of using this framework is to perform data augmentation and apply it to our data. Kornia is a differentiable computer vision library for PyTorch. It consists of a set of routines and differentiable modules to solve generic computer vision problems. At its core, the package uses PyTorch.

### Data
The selected data to work with in this project is a [Pistachio Image](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/pistachio-image-dataset/code) dataset from Kaggle which includes a total of 2148 images. There are 2 types of pistachios: 1232 of Kirmizi pitachios type and 916 of Siirt pistachios type.

### Models
We will work on an image classification task on the pistachio data using some CNN architectures. The models that we will be using 

We intend to perform an image classification task on the rice data using some type of CNN. We expect to be using different models from the TIMM framework such as ConvNeXt, MobileNet V3, ResNet and VGG.
