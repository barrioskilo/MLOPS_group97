### Project structure

## Project Description

### Goal
This is the project description for group 3 in the 02476 Machine Learning Operations course on DTU. The overall goal of the project is to apply the material we have learned in the course to a machine learning problem, while using one of the given frameworks to do so. We will then finally present our findings in a short presentation as well as hand in the written code.

### Framework
The framework we have chosen for this project is the TIMM framework for Computer Vision (PyTorch Image Models). We will be using this framework to construct a deep learning model and apply it to our data. We expect to set up the framework as part of our environment, while writing organized and structured code with version control.

### Data
The data we have initially chosen to work with is a [Rice Image](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset) dataset from Kaggle consisting of 75K images different types of rice. There are 5 total types of rice: Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag and there are 15K images of individual grains of rice for each type.

### Models
We intend to perform an image classification task on the rice data using some type of CNN. We expect to be using different models from the TIMM framework such as ConvNeXt, MobileNet V3, ResNet and VGG.
